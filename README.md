## Box plots - Data Analysis Project 2018 ##

The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate my research into the use of box plots for statistical research and visualisation.

This project must be opened using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). Jupyter Notebooks come installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).




Research

- Make sure to search online for various approaches to the problem, including other people's attempts at solving a similar problem. Summarise the results of this search in the project documentation.



Development

- Make sure you demonstrate an understanding the various tools, libraries and technologies you are using in your assignment.



Consistency

- You should draw up a plan for completing an assignment and make the plan evident in your submission. You should try to stick to this plan, and your project timeline should clearly demonstrate your work towards it.

Documentation

- You should demonstrate how design choices were made at the very beginning of the project, before any code was written, and how at the end of the project you reflected on your work.
